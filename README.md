Modified TrackballScroll allowing both toggle and hold
===============

This is a fork of the original TrackballScroll from Seelge found at https://github.com/Seelge/TrackballScroll and adds the following features when "Emulate middle button when not scrolling" is deactivated via the context menu:

- Holding the button and moving the ball allows scrolling until the button is released similar to the original version
- Clicking the button on its own toggles scroll mode on/off and allows to comfortably scroll through long documents, websites or ebooks without having to hold the button for prolonged periods of time.
