Modified TrackballScroll allowing both toggle and hold
===============

This is a fork of the original TrackballScroll from Seelge found at https://github.com/Seelge/TrackballScroll and adds the following features when "Emulate middle button when not scrolling" is deactivated via the context menu:

- Holding the button and moving the ball allows scrolling until the button is released similar to the original version
- Clicking the button without moving the ball toggles scroll mode on permanently until the button is clicked again and allows to comfortably scroll through long documents, websites or ebooks without having to hold the button for prolonged times.
